I am writing to inform you that I am resigning my position as a Postdoctoral Research Associate effective Tuesday, October 9$^{\textrm{th}}$, 2012.
I will be continuing my physics career as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at TRIUMF, working with Barry Davids.
I would like to thank you for alerting me to this position and for your letter of recommendation %that you wrote for me 
that helped me get this position.  I cannot even begin to properly express the gratitude I have for being able to work with you these past years and I hope that we will be able to continue to collaborate on experiments in the future.
