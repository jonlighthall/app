I am applying for the position of Research Associate as a continuation of my graduate research at Argonne National Laboratory.  The last four years of my Ph.D. thesis work involved the development, commissioning, and operation of the Helical Orbit Spectrometer (HELIOS) at Argonne.  A major component of this work was the development of a data analysis algorithm for data acquired with HELIOS.  I have published the results of the commissioning of HELIOS in a scientific journal and have presented the results at various conferences. 
Based on my experience, detailed here and in the attached CV, I am a qualified candidate for this position.
Thank you for your consideration
