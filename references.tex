\cvwrapper{fancy}{List of References}{
Given below is a list of references; those people whom I have contacted for letters of recommendation.  I have worked in physics research with Dr.\ Alan Wuosmaa since August, 2004; in addition, he was my doctoral thesis advisor and is my current employer.  Dr.\ Birger Back has been my supervisor at Argonne since July 2007.  I worked with Dr.\ Catherine Deibel on a variety of experiments during her postdoc appointment at Argonne from 2008-2011.
%Dr. Paul Pancella was the department chair while I was a student at Western Michigan and it was he that appointed me to my teaching position as a course instructor.  If additional references are need, two more are given.  Scott Marley has been a colleague of mine at both Western Michigan and Argonne since August, 2004.  Finally, Larrs Morey was a student of mine while I was a course instructor.
