\cvwrapper{fancy}{Evidence of Teaching Effectiveness}{% 
\cfoot{}
As detailed in the attached CV, I worked as a teaching assistant from 2001--2006 at Albion College and Western Michigan University.  The majority of that experience involved activities such as grading papers and laboratory instruction.  During my time at Western Michigan, I received three teaching awards, including the 2005--2006 Haym Kruglak Graduate Student Teaching Excellence Award.  In my final semester, I was a course instructor for an introductory physics class.  My section of that class was the first to cover every chapter of the textbook and the average class grade was a full letter-grade higher than previous semesters.\\

For evidence of my teaching effectiveness, I submit the attached documents: 1) the Haym Kruglak Award letter, 2) the summary of the Instructor and Course Evaluations from my lecture class, and 3) a selection of three individual Instructor and Course Evaluations from students.
