My name is Dr.\ Jon Lighthall and I am applying for the Assistant Professor of Physics position.
I am currently employed by Louisiana State University as a senior postdoctoral researcher. My area of study is experimental nuclear physics and I have over 15 years of experience specializing in the technical development of new experimental hardware. I have over 5 years of teaching experience as a tutor, laboratory instructor, and lecturer and have receive outstanding evaluations from students and faculty.

I am currently working at Florida State University and have a number of projects that can be immediately adapted for involvement, development, and leadership by students at Kalamazoo College. 
With the network of collaborators I have developed at laboratories across North America, %The  network of collaborators that I have developed at Argonne and TRIUMF
I can provide students with hands-on research experience on several upcoming experiments. 
In addition, Kalamazoo College is ideally situated to be a key partner in the development of the SOLARIS spectrometer which has been proposed at Michigan State University. I worked on a similar project with a number of undergraduate students at Argonne National Laboratory and I look forward to the chance to continue that work in Michigan.

My undergraduate education at Albion College set the standard for my %pedagogical 
understanding of what it takes to create a teaching environment where studnts can excell. 
The atmosphere of inclusion, respect, and fellowship coupled with compassionate mentoring %fostered a learning environment where students can excell.
is what I strive to duplicate whenever I have the opportunity for instruction.
I hope to provide my students with the same outstanding experience that I received.
My experience at Albion informed my teaching philosophy, which I put into practice at Western Michigan University as a teaching assistant.
I look forward to the possibility of returning to my academic roots at a private liberal arts college in Michigan.%---my one true home.
