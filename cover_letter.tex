My name is Dr.\ Jon Lighthall and I am applying for the Assistant Professor of Physics position.
I am currently employed by Louisiana State University as a senior postdoctoral researcher. My area of study is experimental nuclear physics and I have over 15 years of experience specializing in the technical development of new experimental hardware. 

I am working at Florida State University 

%fellow at TRIUMF where I work in the Nuclear Physics Department in the Physical Science Division under the supervision of Dr.\ Barry Davids. Since October 2012, I have worked with Dr.\ Davids on the commissioning of the Electromagnetic Mass Analysier (EMMA), a heavy recoil spectrometer for nuclear reactions.


I have a network of collaborators across North America The  network of collaborators that I have developed at Argonne and TRIUMF provides the opportunity of collaborating on a number of upcoming experiments, especially in light of the imminent commissioning of the EMMA spectrometer and the start of its scientific program. Provided my schedule allows it, I plan on participating in the approved EMMA experiments and proposing an additional experiment.


My undergraduate education at Albion College
I look forward to the possibility of returning to my academic roots at a private liberal arts college 
I hope to provide my students with the same outstanding experiencece
