My name is Dr.\ Jon Lighthall and I am applying for the Visiting Assistant Professor position.
I graduated from Albion College in 2004.
I am currently employed by Louisiana State University as a senior postdoctoral researcher.
My area of study is experimental nuclear physics and I have over 15 years of experience specializing in the technical development of new experimental hardware.
The majority of experiments I have been involved with are related to nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics.
I have over 5 years of teaching experience as a tutor, laboratory instructor, and lecturer and have received outstanding evaluations from students and faculty.

As an LSU postdoc, I am currently working at Florida State University. 
There are a number of projects that I am working on  %, detailed in my research statement, % and have a number of projects 
that can be immediately adapted for the involvement of students at Albion College. 
The development of these projects will offer students leadership opportunities on an national stage.
With the network of collaborators I have developed at laboratories across North America, %The  network of collaborators that I have developed at Argonne and TRIUMF
I can also provide students with hands-on research experience on several upcoming experiments. 
In addition, Albion College is ideally situated to be a key partner in the development of the SOLARIS spectrometer which has been proposed at Michigan State University. I worked on a similar project with a number of undergraduate students at Argonne National Laboratory and I look forward to the chance to continue that work in Michigan.

My undergraduate education at Albion College set the standard for my %pedagogical 
understanding of what it takes to create a teaching environment where students can excel. 
The atmosphere of inclusion, respect, and fellowship coupled with compassionate mentoring %fostered a learning environment where students can excell.
is what I strive to duplicate whenever I have the opportunity for instruction.
I hope to provide my students with the same outstanding experience that I received.
My experience at Albion informed my teaching philosophy, which I put into practice at Western Michigan University as a teaching assistant.
Since then, I have mentored dozens of students at Argonne, TRIUMF, and FSU.
