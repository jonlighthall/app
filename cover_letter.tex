I am applying for the experimentalist Assistant Physicist  position, Requisition \#323613.  I am currently employed as a postdoctoral research fellow at TRIUMF where I work in the Nuclear Physics Department in the Physical Science Division under the supervision of Dr.\ Barry Davids. Since October 2012, I have worked with Dr.\ Davids on the commissioning of the Electromagnetic Mass Analysier (EMMA), a heavy recoil spectrometer for nuclear reactions. This device is similar to the FMA at Argonne.

Prior to my work at TRIUMF, I was a postdoctoral research assistant and (before that) a laboratory graduate at Argonne. I started collaborating on experiments at Argonne in April 2006 and began full-time work at Argonne in July 2007. While at Argonne, one of my main responsibilities was the 
%The last four years of my doctoral thesis work involved the
 development, commissioning, and operation of the Helical Orbit Spectrometer (HELIOS).
In addition to the substantial technical aspects of this project, a major component of my work was the development of the computer code for the acquisition, calibration, simulation, and analysis of HELIOS data. 
%Since the commissioning of HELIOS, I have been closely involved with every experiment conducted with HELIOS. 
I also collaborated on a variety of experiments using the Enge split-pole spectrograph.

I have over thirteen years of experience specializing in the development of experimental equipment. During that time I have developed a large network of collaborators in the nuclear physics community. % which I plan on %exploiting .
My immediate research interests include nuclear structure and the evolution of single particle states far from stability and nucleosynthesis in the classical \textit{r}-process and the ``cold'' \textit{r}-process.
I plan on carrying out these studies using quasielastic transfer reactions using the variety of experimental equipment at Argonne including HELIOS and the Enge split-pole spectrograph.%, and Gammasphere with the FMA.

My first goal at Argonne will be to update the prototype silicon detector array for the HELIOS spectrometer.

Based on my experience and my research plan, detailed here and in the enclosed documents, I am a uniquely qualified candidate for this position.  I look forward to the possibility of returning to Argonne with my family. Thank you for your consideration.
