I have over thirteen years of experience in physics research, specializing in the technical development of new experimental hardware.
Starting in 2002 as an undergraduate, I helped establish thin film production facilities at Michigan State University and Albion College.
As a graduate student at Western Michigan University, the first three years of my research experience focused two experiments measuring the pair-production branching ratio of the Hoyle state in $^{12}$C using a novel plastic scintillator array.  As a part of this work, I learned to operate the 6\,MeV tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at WMU.  In addition to the typical duties associated with running an experiment---NIM electronics setup, data acquisition and analysis---I also was responsible for designing and machining the detector mounts that were used.  During this time I was also collaborating on a number of experiments at Argonne National Laboratory; these experiments measured transfer reactions on radioactive beams produced in-flight and were measured with an array of double-sided silicon strip detectors.

I began full-time work at Argonne in July 2007 and the last four years of my doctoral thesis work involved the
 development, commissioning, and operation of the Helical Orbit Spectrometer (HELIOS).
 %I worked on nearly every aspect of the development of this new device since the MRI solenoid upon which it is based was delivered to the lab.  One of my first responsibilities was measuring and analyzing a high-resolution field map of the HELIOS solenoid.  I assembled most of the mechanical structures associated with the spectrometer and was involved in the design of many of the mechanical components.
%I designed and constructed the electronics readout, including fabricating most of the cables.
In addition to the substantial technical aspects of this project,
 a major component of my work was the development of the computer code for the acquisition, calibration, simulation, and analysis of HELIOS data. 
%Since the commissioning of HELIOS, I have been closely involved with every experiment conducted with HELIOS.

 the calibration and analysis algorithms for data acquired with HELIOS. 
 I also wrote the proposals for the first two HELIOS experiments and published the results of the first experiment.

%A HELIOS-like spectrometer at FRIB is the ideal device for studying transfer reactions with re-accelerated exotic beams.  
Most of the measurements made with HELIOS have been of transfer reactions with radioactive beams.
At the same time, I also collaborated on a variety of experiments using the Enge split-pole spectrograph. During these experiments, it was typically my responsibility to set up the detector electronics and data acquisition 

Since October 2012,
I have been a postdoctoral research fellow at TRIUMF where I am working
% in the Nuclear Physics Department in the Physical Science Division under the supervision of Dr.\ Barry Davids.  I have worked with Dr.\ Davids 
on the commissioning of the Electromagnetic Mass Analysier (EMMA), a heavy recoil spectrometer for nuclear reactions. %This device is similar to the FMA at Argonne.
Most recently, I wrote the experimental proposal for EMMA's radioactive beam commissioning. Over the last several months I have been developing code for the acquisition, calibration, simulation, and analysis of data from the EMMA PGAC detector based on two in-beam tests. As a part of this work I wrote an extensive safety review of the EMMA gas-handling system. I have also been involved with a number of laborious tasks related to the mechanical development of the spectrometer, including the polishing and assembly of  electrostatic components and the installation of radiation shielding.

\section*{Interests}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Interests}
My research interests reflect my research experience, namely nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics.  More specifically, my immediate 
research interests include %nuclear structure and
 the evolution of single particle states far from stability at the extremes of neutron-excess and nucleosynthesis in the classical \textit{r}-process and the ``cold'' \textit{r}-process (discussed below). In many cases, such as near the $N=50$ and $N=82$ neutron shells, the study of single particle states goes hand-in-hand with the investigations related to the $r$-process%. For example, 
, which rely on the energy and spectroscopic factors of single particle states.
%I am interested in the evolution of single-particle states rich nuclei; 
%such as near the $^{132}$Sn doubly-magic shell closure.  I'm also interested in the properties of nuclei near or on the astrophysical $r$-process path.
%My immediate 

The synthesis of approximately half of the chemical elements heavier than zinc ($A \simeq 70$) occurs in the rapid neutron-capture process.
The exact site of the $r$-process is unknown, but the conditions of

%Classical calculations have been carried out in

In this approach, the reaction path can be  calculated for a given temperature and neutron density via the Saha equation. During equilibrium, the neutron capture rates do not play a role %under these assumptions since
because they are balanced by the photodisintegration reaction rates. 
% In classical calculations, during most of the $r$-process, $n$-capture rates are irrelevant because these reactions are fast enough to establish equilibrium with photodisintegration.
However, at later %\correction{}{r}
 times when 
the temperature and the neutron density drop ("freeze-out phase"), free neutrons %or neutrons which are released from the neutron-rich progenitors via $\beta$-delayed neutron emission 
can be captured and thus shape the final $r$-process abundance curve.
%equilibrium can no longer be maintained, $n$-capture rates on a number of unstable nuclei have appreciable effects on the shapes of the predicted abundance distributions.
Recent work suggests that there may be two sites for producing nuclei previously attributed to a single $r$-process.
%: %\correction{,}{:}
 %merging neutron stars and core collapse supernovae. 
 %While the temperature and neutron density in % in, and entropy in %the former 
 %neutron star mergers appear to be appropriate for synthesizing the heaviest nuclei, the neutrino-driven wind core collapse supernova hypothesis does not result in the electron fractions and entropies needed to produce significant quantities of nuclei with $A\gtrsim130$.
 %However, the observations of $r$-process elements in metal-poor stars cannot easily be explained by 
 %neutron star mergers, which would  occur neither on short enough timescales nor frequently enough to account for the observations \cite{Qian_2000,Argast_2004}. 
 An alternative core collapse supernova $r$-process scenario has recently been proposed % by \citet{Banerjee_2011,Banerjee_2013} %\correction{Banerjee, Qian, Heger, and Haxton}{\citet{Banerjee_2013}} % 
to take place in the He shell of a massive star that has undergone core collapse. 
These %so-called
 ``cold'' $r$-process scenarios
 are not hot enough to %no longer 
 reach the ($\gamma,n)\rightleftharpoons(n,\gamma)$ equilibrium phase. In these scenarios, the $\beta$-decay rates are in equilibrium with neutron capture rates, which drives the reaction path much further neutron-rich and requires general knowledge of neutron capture rates of neutron-rich isotopes.

Direct measurements are impossible in these cases because  the radioactive targets cannot be produced. Instead, $(d,p)$ measurements in inverse kinematics are needed to determine neutron spectroscopic factors, spins, parities, and energies of the relevant states so that the neutron capture cross sections can be calculated.
%At the neutron densities of $\sim10^{19}$\,cm$^{-3}$ found in the He shell $r$-process model,
While studies of nuclei relevant to the classical $r$-process may need to wait for facility upgrades, the nuclei synthesized in the He shell $r$-process model %, %cold $r$-process

%The relatively low temperatures found in the He shell imply that ($\gamma,n)\rightleftharpoons(n,\gamma)$ equilibrium is never

In the short term, my first priority at Argonne will be the construction, characterization, and commissioning of the updated silicon detector array for the HELIOS spectrometer.
%to update the prototype silicon detector array for the HELIOS spectrometer.
This project was underway while I was at Argonne in 2012 as a postdoc and remains unfinished.

HELIOS is already a powerful tool for nuclear spectroscopy and this critical upgrade will help 
advance the scientific program at Argonne by allowing reactions with even lower cross sections and beam intensities to be measured. The inclusion of waveform digitizing electronics may provide additional benefits, including enhanced resolution and efficiency, and warrants investigation.

The recent availability of the new $^3$H target, a number of reactions in inverse kinematics are now possible that %using stable beams that 
allow access to nuclei about which very little is know. Two examples relevant to the ``cold'' $r$-process are $^{87}$Rb($t$,$p$)$^{89}$Rb and $^{86}$Kr($t$,$p$)$^{88}$Kr. Both of these reactions utilize stable beams of $N=50$ nuclei. In both cases, the resultant nuclei have 
%The nucleus $^{88}$Kr has 
only once been studied previously using a quasielastic transfer reaction and relatively little is known in the region of the neutron separation energy of $\textrm{S(n)}\sim 7$\,MeV.
%The previous experiment utilized the ($t$,$p$) two-nucleon transfer reaction in normal kinematics.  A gas cell target filled with enriched, stable $^{86}$Kr was bombarded with a triton beam at $E_t=17.0$\,MeV (5.6\,\AMeV). 
%By contrast, we propose to study the one-neutron transfer reaction ($d$,$p$) in inverse kinematics using the radioactive isotope beam of $^{87}$Kr and a deuterated polyethylene target.
%In the previous transfer measurement, states in $^{88}$Kr were reported up to $E_x=6.4$\,MeV with spins and parities measured up to $E_x=4.9$\,MeV.
%A number of recent $\gamma$-ray studies \cite{Astier_2013,Li_2011,Czerwinski_2013} have identified states in $^{88}$Kr up $E_x=6.4$\,MeV, but little is known in the region of the neutron separation energy of $\textrm{S(n)}=7.053$\,MeV \cite{McCutchan_2014}. No definite spin assignments have been made above $E_x=3.8$\,MeV.
%The nucleus $^{89}$Rb has only once been studied previously using a  transfer reaction in which states in $^{89}$Rb were reported up to $E_x=3.0$\,MeV. Spins and parities for the levels were suggested, but no definite assignments were made.  Only three states  have been identified %are known
 %within $\pm1.5$\,MeV of the  the neutron separation energy. No  spin assignments have been made for these states.
Many of the reactions of interest for the classical $r$-process, such as ($d$,$p$) reactions near the $^{132}$Sn doubly-magic shell closure, require radioactive beam intensities not yet available at ATLAS. However, the planned intensity upgrades for the CARIBU ion source will make many of these %radioactive
 beams available, particularly in the $A \geq 130$ region. Once these beams are available, studying them with transfer reactions would be one of my research priorities.
